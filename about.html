                    Crane and Kauffman began developing Friends under the title "Insomnia Cafe" in November 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, with whom they had previously worked, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the series to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, the series was finally named "Friends" and premiered on NBC's coveted Thursday 8:30 pm timeslot. Filming for the series took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California in front of a live audience.

                    Friends received positive reviews throughout its run, and became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. The series won many awards and was nominated for 63 Primetime Emmy Awards. The series was also very successful in the ratings, consistently ranking in the top ten in the final primetime ratings. Friends has made a large cultural impact, and the Central Perk coffee house featured prominently in the series has inspired various imitations worldwide. Repeats of the series continue to air worldwide, while each season has been released on DVD. Following the series finale, the spin-off series Joey was created, and rumors of a film continue to circulate although have been repeatedly denied. A reunion of the main cast is scheduled for broadcast on the streaming service HBO Max during 2020. However the reunion has been postponed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. This has fuled further speculation that a new series of Friends will be commissioned. The reunion was finally filmed in April 2021 and aired in May 2021.

                        <i class="about-name">Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Greene</i> is the spoiled but warm-hearted and likeable daughter of a rich vascular surgeon and his wife. Rachel is introduced into the series in the first episode after she leaves her fiancé, Barry, at the altar, and attempts to live independently without financial support from her parents. She flees from her almost-wedding to New York City to find Monica Geller, her friend from high school. Rachel moves into Monica's apartment and meets Phoebe Buffay, and Joey Tribbiani. Rachel already knows Ross Geller, Monica's brother, as all three went to the same high school and also Chandler Bing as he was Ross's college buddy. Rachel's first job is as a waitress at Central Perk coffee house. She later begins to work in fashion, becoming an assistant buyer, and later a personal shopper, at Bloomingdale's. She eventually becomes a buyer at Polo Ralph Lauren. A great deal of Rachel's life throughout the series revolves around her relationship with Ross Geller. They date for twelve months during season 2 and three. At the end of season five they get drunkenly married in Las Vegas. At the end of season seven, during Monica's and Chandler's wedding, it is revealed that Rachel is pregnant from a one-night stand with Ross. Initially, Rachel is determined to raise the baby on her own, but later she realizes she needs Ross's help. She decides to move in with Ross, even though the two are not involved in a relationship. Their daughter, Emma, is born during the eighth-season finale. During the tenth season, Rachel is offered a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. She accepts and prepares to move herself and Emma to France. However, in the series finale, she declines the job offer and famously "gets off the plane". Rachel and Ross get back together in the final episode of the series. It's hinted in The Pilot episode of Joey (TV Series) that Ross and Rachel might have remarried, although that statement is vague and can be interpreted in different ways.

                        <i class="about-name">Courteney Cox as Monica Geller</i> is the mother hen of the group, who is known for her obsessive-compulsive and competitive nature. Monica is often jokingly teased by the others, especially her brother Ross, for having been extremely overweight as a child. Monica is an intelligent, kind-hearted person who works primarily as a chef at a variety of restaurants throughout the show. In the second season, Monica falls for her father Jack's (Elliott Gould) friend, Richard Burke (Tom Selleck). Despite the twenty-one year age difference, Monica and Richard are happy, and her parents accept their relationship. However, as a result of Monica yearning for a family but Richard having already had one, they break up at the end of the second season. Monica then pursues a chain of various men until she unexpectedly begins a relationship with her longtime friend, Chandler Bing, at the end of the fourth season, during her brother Ross' wedding to Emily Waltham. Monica and Chandler try to hide their relationship from the rest of the group for much of the fifth season, but eventually everyone finds out. After celebrating their first anniversary in Las Vegas, they move in together and get engaged by the sixth-season finale. After their marriage, Monica and Chandler try to conceive children, only to discover that they are unable to do so. In the final season of the series, they adopt two children, whom they name Erica and Jack.

                        <i class="about-name">Lisa Kudrow as Phoebe Buffay</i> is an odd, ditzy albeit sweet-natured masseuse who grew up homeless, sometimes telling her friends outlandish tales of life on the street. She is an aspiring musician who plays the guitar and sings songs with somewhat unusual lyrics at the coffee shop. She has an identical twin sister, Ursula (also played by Kudrow), who is just as odd as Phoebe and appeared as a recurring character on Mad About You. After a series of dates and relationships with a number of men, Phoebe meets Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) in season nine, whom she eventually marries in season ten. She also became a surrogate mother for her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi), giving birth to his triplets in the fifth season.

                        <i class="about-name">Matt Le Blanc as Joey Tribbiani</i> is a good-natured but not-so-bright struggling actor and food lover, who becomes mildly famous for his role as Dr. Drake Ramoray on a fictionalized version of Days of Our Lives. Joey is a womanizer, with many girlfriends throughout the series, often using his catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?" He develops a crush on Rachel in season eight but nothing happens until Rachel falls for Joey at the end of season nine. They date for about a week, becoming official in Barbados but they end the relationship because they can never be more than best friends. Matt Le Blanc got a spin off show called Joey once the series finished because Joey's character didn't have a resolute ending.

                        <i class="about-name">Matthew Perry as Chandler Bing</i> is an executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration for a large multi-national corporation, a job which he despises. Because of this, Chandler later quits his job and becomes a junior copywriter at an advertising agency. Chandler is known for his sarcastic sense of humor. An intelligent man at the end of the day (despite all his goofy quirkiness), he often mocks his best friend Joey for the latter's stupidity. Chandler is often depicted as being somewhat of a hapless individual, suffering a lot of bad luck while struggling through life and occasionally struggling with an on-and-off smoking addiction. He dated the well-known nasal character Janice who annoyed everyone and eventually aggravated Chandler. However, he eventually falls in deep mutual love with Monica; an emotional Chandler tells her that she "makes him happier than he ever thought he could be" while proposing to her at the close of season six, with the two of them marrying at the close of season seven. By the end of the series, he and Monica adopt twins, whom they name Jack and Erica.

                        <i class="about-name">David Schwimmer as Ross Geller</i> is a paleontologist at a museum of prehistory, and later a professor of paleontology at New York University. The most intelligent of the six main characters, but at the same time a clumsy, quirky man, Ross is known for being a know-it-all who prides himself on his rationality, despite his clear hopeless romanticism. Monica's older brother, Chandler's college roommate, and Rachel's on-again, off-again boyfriend, Ross has three failed marriages during the series (including a drunken marriage to Rachel in Las Vegas) and is involved in an on-and-off relationship with Rachel, which is a main storyline throughout the series. He is also the father of his ex-wife Carol's son, Ben, and Rachel's daughter, Emma. In the series finale, Ross and Rachel finally reconcile, deciding to be together once and for all. It's hinted in The Pilot episode of Joey (TV Series) that Ross and Rachel might have remarried, although that statement is vague and can be interpreted in different ways.
